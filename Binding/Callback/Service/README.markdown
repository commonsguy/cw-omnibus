This sample Android app demonstrates
the service side of a pair of apps that communicate using remote services and AIDL, where the client provides a callback object (also implemented in AIDL) to the service to get results asynchronously.

This app is covered in 
[the chapter on remote services](https://commonsware.com/Android/previews/remote-services-and-the-binding-pattern)
in [*The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development*](https://commonsware.com/Android/).
