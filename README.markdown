Welcome to the source code for _The Busy Coder's Guide to Android
Development_!

The names of the top-level directories roughly correspond to a
shortened form of the chapter titles. Since chapter numbers
change with every release, and since some samples are used by
multiple chapters, I am loathe to put chapter numbers in the
actual directory names.

If you wish to use this code, you should delete build.xml from the project, then run
  `android update project -p ...`  (where ... is the path to a project of interest)
	on those projects you wish to use, so the build files are
	updated for your Android SDK version.
