Welcome to the source code for [_The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development_](https://commonsware.com/Android)!

## About the Book

_The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development_ is a book covering Android application development, from basics
through advanced capabilities. It is updated several times a year and is available through
[the Warescription](https://commonsware.com/warescription) program. Subscribers also have access to office
hours chats and other benefits.

This repository contains the source code for the hundreds of sample apps profiled in the book. These 
samples are updated as the book is, with `git` tags applied to tie sample code versions to book
versions.

The book, and the samples, were written by Mark Murphy. You may also have run into him through
Stack Overflow:

## About the Code

All of the source code in this archive is licensed under the
Apache 2.0 license except as noted.

The names of the top-level directories roughly correspond to a
shortened form of the chapter titles. Since chapter numbers
change with every release, and since some samples are used by
multiple chapters, I am loathe to put chapter numbers in the
actual directory names.

## Using in Android Studio

All of the projects should have a `build.gradle` file suitable for
importing the project into Android Studio. Note, though, that you
may need to adjust the `compileSdkVersion` in `build.gradle` if it
requests an SDK that you have not downloaded and do not wish to
download. Similarly, you may need to adjust the `buildToolsVersion`
value to refer to a version of the build tools that you have downloaded
from the SDK Manager.

The samples also have stub Gradle wrapper files, enough to allow for
easy import into Android Studio. However,
**always check the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file before importing anything into Android Studio**,
as there is always the chance that somebody has published material linking you to a hacked Gradle installation.

## Using with Command-Line Gradle

Right now, you will need your own local installation of Gradle 2.1
in order to build the projects from the command line, as the repository
does not contain `gradlew` or its corresponding JAR for security reasons.

## Projects Structure

Projects in this book have a mix of structures. Some use the new
Android Studio structure. Others use the older Eclipse structure.
The Eclipse-style projects, though, are set up to still be able
to be imported into Android Studio &mdash; it is just that the files will
be in the directory structure used by Eclipse rather than in Android Studio's
natural structure.

Slowly, this book is being converted over to having all projects use
the Android Studio structure. This process should be completed sometime
in 2016.
